This repository demonstrates a race condition bug in HTML where JavaScript attempts to manipulate the DOM element before the element is fully parsed and added to the DOM.  The bug is subtle because it doesn't always manifest and depends on the timing of the script execution relative to the page's rendering. The solution demonstrates a common and robust way to fix the race condition using event listeners.
